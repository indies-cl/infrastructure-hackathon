## Overview

The first screen is On-Site: an empty dark stage, date on the left, Geist Pixel title and one-liner at the bottom of the field. Below the fold the page becomes Kernel: large Pixel titles, readable Quattro, a proof row, numbered asks, then the same facts.

Ground is `#181818`. Ink is `#d6d4d0`. Purple `#6d4aff` lives in the flag's red, passed through the ASCII field, and in focus. Geist Pixel Circle is for headlines. iA Writer Quattro is for everything else. Hero chrome stays 16px / 18px. The document opens up.

## Colors

Background `#181818`. Ink `#d6d4d0`. Muted `#9a9890` for supporting lines. Invert hover paints the ink as the field. Selection is the same invert. Purple is the flag's red in the ASCII field, and the focus ring.

## Typography

Geist Pixel Circle for the hero title, document titles, and proof figures. iA Writer Quattro for the date, the one-liner, and the document. Sentence case. Prose measure stays near 65ch. Hero title: 32 / 48 / 64. Section titles: 32 / 48. Proof figures: 32 / 48.

## Layout

Fixed header, 16px from the edges: `7–8 Nov 2026. Santiago de Chile` on the left. The stage is one viewport tall. The Pixel title sits bottom-left on the field, two lines: Infrastructure / Hackathon. The one-liner sits under it. Below the fold: 1060px, manifesto, four figures, numbered asks, orgs, tracks, tiers, then the mail.

## Elevation & Depth

No shadows, no blur, no cards. The depth is a slowed Chilean flag, drawn as ASCII, under the Pixel title.

## Shapes

Squares. Invert hover is a rectangle behind the glyphs. No pills, no buttons.

## Components

Links invert on hover. The title is Geist Pixel. Behind it, a looping flag video is sampled onto an ASCII grid through a shader, played at 0.75×. Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the video holds one frame. Source: Pixabay 313898 at `/brand/stage-313898.mp4`. Previous: Pexels 20452931 at `/brand/stage.mp4`.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do keep the date, city, and duration on the first screen.
- Do change hierarchy with face and size in the document; keep the hero chrome at one size.
- Don't add a totem date, a mountain plate, or a marketing close.
